			<h2 id=AssociationFootball>Association Football</h2>
				<p class="big">Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport 			played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.</p>
			
			<h2 id="history">History</h2>
			<p class="small">According to <a href="http://www.fifa.com/">FIFA</a> the competitive game cuju is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence.[8] It occurs namely as an exercise in a military manual from the third and second centuries BC.[8] Documented evidence of an activity resembling football can be found in the Chinese military manual Zhan Guo Ce compiled between the 3rd century and 1st century BC.[9]Two of the earliest recorded football-type games in Europe include Episkyros[10][11] from Ancient Greece and the Roman version Harpastum[10] which similar to pre-codified "Mob Football", the antecedent of all modern football codes,[12] involved more handling the ball than kicking.[13][14] Players were tasked with kicking a ball into a net affixed to bamboo poles, using only their feet, chest, back or shoulders.[15] Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.</p>
	
			<h2 id="Womensassociationfootball">Womens association football</h2>
				<p class="small">Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[37][38] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[38] This perception began to change in the 1970s with the breakthrough of organised women's association football. Association football is the most prominent team sport for women in several countries, and one of the few women's team sports with professional leagues.</p>
		
			<h2 id="Etymologyandnames">Etymology and names</h2>
			<p class="small">The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford "-er" abbreviation of the word "association".</p>

			<h2 id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
			<p class="small">Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball (of 71 cm (28 in) circumference in <a href="http://www.fifa.com/"> FIFA</a> play), known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.[43]</p>
		
			<p> Here is a quote from the Wikipedia website: </p>

			<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">
<b>There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[52] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.</b>
